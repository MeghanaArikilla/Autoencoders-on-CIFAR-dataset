# Autoencoders-on-CIFAR-dataset
Autoencoders are a type of feedforward neural networks where input will be same as the output. Autoencoders will lower the dimensions of the input which is known as latent-space representation. We can reconstruct the output from the latent-space representation. In autoencoders we have encoding stage, decoding stage and loss function. These are used for dimensionality reduction. I used these autoencoders on CIFAR dataset.
